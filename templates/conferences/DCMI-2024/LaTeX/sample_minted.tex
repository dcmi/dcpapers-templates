\section{Introduction}

DCPapers article template provides a consistent \LaTeX{} style for
use across DCMI-2024 publications, and incorporates accessibility and
metadata-extraction functionality. This document will explain the
major features of the document class.

The ``\verb|ceurart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any DCPapers publication, and for any stage of publication, from
review to final ``camera-ready'' copy with {\itshape very} few changes
to the source.

This class depends on the following packages
for its proper functioning:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|natbib.sty| for citation processing;
\item \verb|geometry.sty| for margin settings;
\item \verb|graphicx.sty| for graphics inclusion;
\item \verb|hyperref.sty| optional package if hyperlinking is required in
  the document;
\item \verb|fontawesome5.sty| optional package for bells and whistles.
\end{itemize}

All the above packages are part of any
standard \LaTeX{} installation.
Therefore, the users need not be
bothered about downloading any extra packages.

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \mintinline{latex}{\vspace} command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

\section{Template parameters}

There are a number of template
parameters which modify some part of the \verb|ceurart| document class.
This parameters are enclosed in square
brackets and are a part of the \mintinline{latex}{\documentclass} command:
\begin{minted}{latex}
  \documentclass[parameter]{ceurart}
\end{minted}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \mintinline{latex}{twocolumn} : Two column layout.
\item \mintinline{latex}{hf} : Enable header and footer\footnote{You can enable
    the display of page numbers in the final version of the entire
    collection. In this case, you should adhere to the end-to-end
    pagination of individual papers.}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Front matter}

\subsection{Title Information}

The titles of papers should be either all use the emphasizing
capitalized style or they should all use the regular English (or
native language) style. It does not make a good impression if you or
your authors mix the styles.

Use the \mintinline{latex}{\title} command to define the title of your work. Do not
insert line breaks in your title.

\subsection{Title variants}

\mintinline{latex}{\title} command have the below options:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|title|: Document title. This is default option. 
\begin{minted}{latex}
\title[mode=title]{This is a title}
\end{minted}
You can just omit it, like as follows:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\title{This is a title}
\end{minted}

\item \verb|alt|: Alternate title.
\begin{minted}{latex}
\title[mode=alt]{This is a alternate title}
\end{minted}

\item \verb|sub|: Sub title.
\begin{minted}{latex}
\title[mode=sub]{This is a sub title}
\end{minted}
You can just use \mintinline{latex}{\subtitle} command, as follows:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\subtitle{This is a sub title}
\end{minted}

\item \verb|trans|: Translated title.
\begin{minted}{latex}
\title[mode=trans]{This is a translated title}
\end{minted}

\item \verb|transsub|: Translated sub title.
\begin{minted}{latex}
\title[mode=transsub]{This is a translated sub title}
\end{minted}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification. Multiple authors may share one affiliation. Authors'
names should not be abbreviated; use full first names wherever
possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever possible.

\mintinline{latex}{\author} command have the below options: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \mintinline{latex}{style} : Style of author name (chinese)
\item \mintinline{latex}{prefix} : Prefix
\item \mintinline{latex}{suffix} : Suffix
\item \mintinline{latex}{degree} : Degree
\item \mintinline{latex}{role} : Role
\item \mintinline{latex}{orcid} : ORCID
\item \mintinline{latex}{email} : E-mail
\item \mintinline{latex}{url} : URL
\end{itemize}

Author names can have some kinds of marks and notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item affiliation mark: \mintinline{latex}{\author[<num>]}.
\end{itemize}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use an explicit mark to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}

Author block example:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\author[1,2]{Author Name}[%
    prefix=Prof.,
    degree=D.Sc.,
    role=Researcher,
    orcid=0000-0000-000-0000,
    email=name@example.com,
    url=https://name.example.com
]

\address[1]{Affiliation #1}
\address[2]{Affiliation #2}
\end{minted}

\subsection{Abstract and Keywords}

Abstract shall be entered in an environment that starts
with \mintinline{latex}{\begin{abstract}} and ends with
\mintinline{latex}{\end{abstract}}. 

\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{abstract}
  This is an abstract.
\end{abstract}
\end{minted}

The key words are enclosed in a \mintinline{latex}{keywords}
environment. Use \mintinline{latex}{\sep} to separate keywords.

\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{keywords}
  First keyword \sep 
  Second keyword \sep 
  Third keyword \sep 
  Fourth keyword
\end{keywords}
\end{minted}

At the end of front matter add \mintinline{latex}{\maketitle} command.

\subsection{Various Marks in the Front Matter}

The front matter becomes complicated due to various kinds
of notes and marks to the title and author names. Marks in
the title will be denoted by a star ($\star$) mark;
footnotes are denoted by super scripted Arabic numerals,
corresponding author by an Conformal asterisk (*) mark.

\subsubsection{Title marks}

Title mark can be entered by the command, \mintinline{latex}{\tnotemark[<num>]}
and the corresponding text can be entered with the command
\mintinline{latex}{\tnotetext[<num>]{<text>}}. An example will be:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\title{A better way to format your document for CEUR-WS}

\tnotemark[1]
\tnotetext[1]{You can use this document as the template for preparing your
  publication. We recommend using the latest version of the ceurart style.}
\end{minted}

\mintinline{latex}{\tnotemark} and \mintinline{latex}{\tnotetext} can be anywhere in
the front matter, but should be before \mintinline{latex}{\maketitle} command.

\subsubsection{Author marks}

Author names can have some kinds of marks and notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item footnote mark : \mintinline{latex}{\fnmark[<num>]}
\item footnote text : \mintinline{latex}{\fntext[<num>]{<text>}}
\item corresponding author mark : \mintinline{latex}{\cormark[<num>]}
\item corresponding author text : \mintinline{latex}{\cortext[<num>]{<text>}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other marks}

At times, authors want footnotes which leave no marks in
the author names. The note text shall be listed as part of
the front matter notes. Class files provides
\mintinline{latex}{\nonumnote} for this purpose. The usage
\begin{minted}{latex}
\nonumnote{<text>}
\end{minted}
and should be entered anywhere before the \mintinline{latex}{\maketitle}
command for this to take effect. 

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX{} sectioning commands:
\mintinline{latex}{\section}, \mintinline{latex}{\subsection},
\mintinline{latex}{\subsubsection}, and
\mintinline{latex}{\paragraph}. They should be numbered; do not remove
the numbering from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is not allowed.

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|ceurart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed \textit{above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \verb|table| to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption. The contents of the table itself must go in the
\verb|tabular| environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \verb|table*| to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Math Equations}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \verb|math| environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\mintinline{latex}{\begin} \ldots \mintinline{latex}{\end} construction or with
the short form \verb|$| \ldots \verb|$|. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX};
this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0,
\end{math}
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}

A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \verb|equation|
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\verb|displaymath| environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX{}; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0.
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \verb|displaymath|
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  S_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} ,
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{x \to 0} (1 + x)^{1/x} = e
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader. Figure captions go below the figure. Your figures should
also include a description suitable for screen readers, to
assist the visually-challenged to better understand your work.

Figure captions are placed below the figure.

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of Bib\TeX{} for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \mintinline{latex}{\end{document}}
command:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\bibliography{bibfile}
\end{minted}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the Bib\TeX{} file.


\subsection{Some examples}

A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated journal
article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue
\cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
\cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so series
should not be present since it has no vol. no.), a chapter in a
divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book in a
series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book \cite{Knuth97},
an article in a proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for
example) (paginated proceedings article) \cite{Andler79}, a
proceedings article with all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an
example of an enumerated proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an
informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a doctoral dissertation
\cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online
document / world wide web resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07,
  Poker06}, a video game (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2)
\cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and (Case 3) a patent
\cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication \cite{rous08},
prolific author \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other
cites might contain `duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
\cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Multi-volume works as books
\cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A couple of citations with DOIs:
